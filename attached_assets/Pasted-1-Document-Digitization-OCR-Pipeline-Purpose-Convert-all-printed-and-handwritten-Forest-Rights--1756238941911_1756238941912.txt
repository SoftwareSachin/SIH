1. Document Digitization & OCR Pipeline

Purpose: Convert all printed and handwritten Forest Rights Act (FRA) claim documents into machine-readable text.
Key Functions:

Scanning & Preprocessing: Enhance image quality, remove noise, skew correction.

OCR Engine: Extract text from printed and handwritten documents (multi-language support).

Output Formats: Store results as structured JSON or database records.

Integration: Pass extracted text to the NER system for further processing.

2. Named Entity Recognition (NER) for FRA Claims Data

Purpose: Automatically detect and extract key claim details from OCR output.
Data to Extract:

Claimant name(s)

Village name

Area claimed (in acres/hectares)

Claim type (IFR – Individual Forest Rights, CR – Community Rights, CFR – Community Forest Rights)

Claim status (pending, approved, rejected)

Important dates (application date, approval date, etc.)

Geographic coordinates (if available)

Output: Structured claim records ready for spatial linking in GIS.

3. Interactive WebGIS Platform

Purpose: Provide a map-based interface for visualization and analysis of claims and assets.
Features:

Satellite Imagery Integration: High-resolution imagery from public or licensed sources.

Multiple Data Layers: Claims boundaries, village boundaries, land-use, assets, infrastructure.

Layer Control: Turn layers on/off, adjust transparency, reorder layers.

Zoom & Pan: Map navigation for district, block, and village-level views.

Spatial Query: Search and highlight claims/assets based on location or attributes.

4. AI/ML-based Land-Use Classification

Purpose: Identify and classify land cover from satellite images.
Classes to Detect:

Agriculture land

Forest areas

Water bodies

Built-up areas (settlements, roads, etc.)

Approach:

Pre-trained CNN or Random Forest on remote sensing data.

Post-processing to align with GIS layers.

5. Asset Detection

Purpose: Automatically detect physical and social infrastructure assets relevant to FRA claims.
Assets to Detect:

Ponds and water bodies

Homesteads (houses, compounds)

Farms and cultivation areas

Social infrastructure (schools, health centers, community halls)

Use Cases:

Identify existing resources for scheme eligibility.

Cross-verify claims with asset proximity.

6. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

Purpose: Ensure secure and restricted access to system functionalities.
Roles:

Admin: Full access, manage system settings, approve/reject claims.

State Officer: View and approve district data for their state.

District Officer: Manage claims within their district.

Field Officer: Upload documents, perform verifications.

NGO Partner: Submit supporting documents and assist in claims.

Public User: View approved claim maps and public datasets.

7. Decision Support System (DSS)

Purpose: Recommend suitable Central Sector Schemes (CSS) and state schemes to claimants.
Key Functions:

Rule-Based Eligibility Engine: Match claimant data with scheme requirements.

Scheme Knowledge Base: Maintain database of eligibility rules.

Recommendation Output: Provide ranked list of schemes with application guidance.

8. Claims Data Management System

Purpose: Centralized management of all claims and their spatial data.
Features:

Store data in IFR, CR, CFR schemas.

Link claims with spatial boundaries (polygon mapping).

Maintain metadata (upload date, uploaded by, verification status).

9. Verification Workflow & Audit Trails

Purpose: Standardize and track claim verification processes.
Workflow Stages:

Document Upload → OCR & NER → Spatial Linking → Field Verification → Approval/Rejection.

Each action recorded with timestamp, role, and user ID.

Audit trails for compliance and transparency.

10. REST APIs for Data Operations

Purpose: Allow integration with external systems and enable modular development.
Key APIs:

Claims CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)

Bulk data import/export (CSV, JSON, GeoJSON)

Document upload & OCR trigger API

Scheme recommendation API

GIS data retrieval API
