Essential items that must be included in the project

Below is a concise, focused checklist of things that must be part of your FRA-Atlas + WebGIS + DSS project (only items required by the problem statement — no extras).

Data & ingestion

Canonical claims dataset (IFR / CR / CFR) schema and ingestion pipeline (CSV/PDF/image import).

Legacy document digitization pipeline (OCR for printed + handwritten + attachments).

Village / administrative boundary shapefiles (GeoJSON/Shapefile, EPSG:4326).

Patta-holder spatial linking (ability to attach claim → village polygon / homestead point).

Provenance metadata for each record (source, date, confidence).

Spatial & remote-sensing inputs

High-resolution satellite imagery baselayers (integrated in WebGIS).

Raster/vector support (GeoTIFF, tile service, GeoJSON).

Relevant ancillary layers: forest boundaries, groundwater index, major infrastructure.

AI / processing components

NER / information-extraction to parse claims (name, village, area, status, dates, coords).

Land-use classification (LULC) model to identify agriculture/forest/water/built-up.

Asset detection models to identify ponds, homesteads, farms, other capital/social assets.

Model versioning and per-feature confidence scores.

WebGIS & visualization

Interactive map viewer with layer toggles, legends, popups.

Feature detail panel showing extracted claim fields + attached scanned docs.

Filters & search (state → district → village → claimant → claim status).

Ability to upload/download GeoJSON/Shapefile and export query results.

Decision Support System (DSS)

Rule-based eligibility engine to map patta-holders → applicable CSS schemes.

Priority scoring mechanism for interventions (water, livelihoods, infrastructure).

Exportable recommendations (PDF/CSV) for officers.

Workflows & verification

Verification workflow for field-inspectors (status updates, photo attachments, sign-off).

Audit trail for every status change (user, timestamp, notes).

Mobile-capable data capture (forms + attachments) with offline sync support.

Access, roles & security

Role-based access control (RBAC) (Admin, State, District, Field, NGO, Public).

Data encryption in transit & at rest; HTTPS enforced.

PII masking/anonymization options for exports.

APIs & integration

REST APIs for CRUD on claims, villages, assets, and DSS outputs.

Batch import/export endpoints for bulk data exchange.

Validation, testing & metrics

Validation dataset & metrics for OCR/NER and CV models (accuracy, precision/recall, CER).

Ground-truthing plan (small real sample) and active-learning feedback loop.

Documentation & deliverables

Data statement (synthetic vs real, consent status, limitations).

README, API documentation, deployment steps, and user manual.

Demo package: sample dataset, short demo video, slide deck, and instructions to reproduce.

Legal, ethics & policy

Written consent / MoU templates for real data access.

Privacy & tribal community consent procedures documented.

Anonymization and data-retention policy.

Operations & scalability

Storage strategy for imagery & documents (object storage + backups).

Model & data versioning, backup, monitoring, and basic alerting.
