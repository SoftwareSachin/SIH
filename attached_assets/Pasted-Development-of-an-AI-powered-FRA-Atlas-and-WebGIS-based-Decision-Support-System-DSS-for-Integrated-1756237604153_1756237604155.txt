Development of an AI-powered FRA Atlas and WebGIS-based Decision Support System (DSS) for Integrated Monitoring of Forest Rights Act (FRA) Implementation (States to be concentrated: Madhya Pradesh, Tripura, Odisha, Telangana)

Problem background

The Forest Rights Act (FRA), 2006 recognizes the rights of forest-dwelling communities over land and forest resources. However, significant challenges persist:

Legacy records of Individual Forest Rights (IFR), Community Rights (CR), and Community Forest Resource Rights (CFR) are scattered, non-digitized, and difficult to verify.

There is no centralized, real-time visual repository (e.g., an FRA Atlas) of FRA claims and granted titles.

Integration of satellite-based asset mapping (land, water bodies, farms, etc.) with FRA data is missing.

Integration of legacy data with an FRA Atlas is missing.

Decision-makers lack a Decision Support System (DSS) to layer Central Sector Schemes (CSS) benefits (e.g., PM-KISAN, Jal Jeevan Mission, MGNREGA, DAJGUA) for FRA patta holders.

Project objectives

Digitize and standardize legacy data of FRA claims, verifications, and pattas, and integrate FRA patta holdersâ€™ shapefiles with an FRA Atlas.

Create an FRA Atlas showing potential and granted FRA areas using AI and satellite data.

Integrate a WebGIS portal to visualize and manage spatial and socio-economic data.

Use Remote Sensing and AI/ML to map capital and social assets (ponds, farms, forest resources) of FRA-holding villages.

Build a Decision Support System (DSS) to recommend and layer Central Sector Schemes based on mapped data, enhancing targeted development.

AI & tech components

Data Digitization

Use suitable models to extract and standardize text from scanned FRA documents.

Apply Named Entity Recognition (NER) to identify village names, patta holders, coordinates, and claim status.

AI-based Asset Mapping

Employ Computer Vision on high-resolution satellite imagery to detect:

Agricultural land

Forest cover

Water bodies (ponds, streams)

Homesteads

Classify land-use using supervised ML models (e.g., Random Forest, CNN).

Add layers of information with respect to forest data, groundwater data, and infrastructure data (e.g., PM Gati Shakti).

WebGIS Integration

Interactive layers (IFR/CR, village boundaries, land-use, assets).

Filters by state/district/village/tribal group.

FRA progress tracking (village/block/district/state level).

Decision Support System (DSS)

Build a rule-based plus AI-enhanced DSS engine that:

Cross-links FRA holders with eligibility for CSS schemes such as DAJGUA and others.

Prioritizes interventions (e.g., borewells under Jal Shakti for villages with low water index).

Deliverables

AI-processed digital archive of FRA claims and decisions.

An interactive FRA Atlas on a WebGIS platform.

AI-generated asset maps for all FRA villages.

A DSS engine for scheme layering and policy formulation.

Target users

Ministry of Tribal Affairs

District-level Tribal Welfare Departments & Line Departments of DAJGUA

Forest and Revenue Departments

Planning & Development Authorities
